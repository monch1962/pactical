# Pact editor

One of the challenges for inexperienced users may be how to go about generating Pacts.

The HTML file included here is an attempt to make it easier. It opens up a form based on the Pact schema, designed to make it easier for non-technical users to construct Pacts.

To use it, simply open `pact-editor.html` in a web browser.

No idea what instructions will be required to use this - I'm just throwing it out to see if it's of any use...

Full credit for the JSON schema editor should go to https://json-editor.github.io/json-editor/ 

I simply lifted their code and adapted it slightly for use as a Pact editor
